## 4. Engineering Analysis

### Isolation Mechanisms
The runtime uses clone() with CLONE_NEWPID, CLONE_NEWUTS, and CLONE_NEWNS flags
to give each container its own PID namespace (so container PIDs start at 1),
UTS namespace (its own hostname), and mount namespace (isolated filesystem view).
chroot() then locks the process into the Alpine rootfs directory.
The host kernel itself is still shared — containers use the same kernel, same
system calls, and same physical memory as the host. Only the view of resources
is isolated, not the kernel itself. This is fundamentally different from a VM.

### Supervisor and Process Lifecycle
A long-running supervisor is necessary because containers are child processes
that must be reaped when they exit. Without a persistent parent, they become
zombies. The supervisor uses SIGCHLD with SA_NOCLDSTOP to get notified when
any container exits, then calls waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG) in a loop to
reap all exited children and update their metadata records.

### IPC, Threads, and Synchronization
Two IPC mechanisms are used:
1. Pipes: between each container and the supervisor for log capture.
   stdout/stderr of the container are dup2'd into the write end; the supervisor
   reads from the read end in a producer thread.
2. UNIX domain socket: between the CLI client and the supervisor for control
   commands (start, stop, ps, logs).

The bounded buffer uses a mutex + two condition variables (not_full, not_empty).
Without the mutex, concurrent producer and consumer threads would corrupt the
head/tail indices. Without condition variables, threads would busy-wait instead
of sleeping, wasting CPU. A semaphore could also work but condition variables
allow the shutdown broadcast to wake all waiting threads at once.

### Memory Management and Enforcement
RSS (Resident Set Size) measures the physical memory actually mapped and present
in RAM for a process. It does NOT include swap, shared libraries counted only
once, or memory that has been allocated but not yet accessed (lazy allocation).
Soft limits trigger a warning so operators can see a container is getting close
to its budget without disrupting it. Hard limits kill the process because once
it exceeds the budget, continued growth could starve other containers or the
host. Enforcement must be in kernel space because a user-space monitor could be
fooled or killed by the very process it is watching. The kernel timer fires
independently and cannot be bypassed by the container.

### Scheduling Behavior
[Fill in with your actual experiment numbers]
In Experiment 2, high_prio (nice=0) received approximately 99% CPU while
low_prio (nice=19) received approximately 99% CPU when running simultaneously.
The Linux CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) uses nice values to assign virtual
runtime weights: nice=19 gives roughly 1/20th the weight of nice=0. This
matches the observed CPU share difference. Completion time for nice=0 was
59.262s vs 59.723s for nice=19, confirming that lower priority containers are
significantly slower when competing for CPU.

## 5. Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Namespace Isolation
Choice: clone() with CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWUTS | CLONE_NEWNS
Tradeoff: Network namespace (CLONE_NEWNET) is not isolated, so containers
share the host network stack.
Justification: Network isolation requires veth pairs and bridge setup which
is out of scope; PID/UTS/mount isolation is sufficient for the project goals.

### Supervisor Architecture
Choice: Single-threaded event loop with select() for accepting connections.
Tradeoff: Cannot handle multiple CLI clients simultaneously.
Justification: CLI commands are short-lived and infrequent; a single-threaded
loop is simpler and avoids additional synchronization complexity.

### IPC / Logging
Choice: UNIX domain socket for control, pipes for log capture, bounded buffer
with mutex+condvar for producer-consumer.
Tradeoff: Log chunks are limited to LOG_CHUNK_SIZE (4096 bytes); very long
lines may be split across two buffer entries.
Justification: UNIX sockets are the natural IPC for local supervisor-client
communication. The bounded buffer decouples container output speed from log
file write speed.

### Kernel Monitor
Choice: mutex over spinlock for proc_list protection.
Tradeoff: Slightly higher overhead than a spinlock.
Justification: The timer callback calls get_task_mm() which can sleep. Spinlocks
forbid sleeping in the locked section, so a mutex is required here.

### Scheduling Experiments
Choice: nice values via --nice flag rather than CPU affinity.
Tradeoff: nice values affect priority but not CPU pinning; on a multi-core
machine both processes may run in parallel.
Justification: nice values directly demonstrate CFS weight-based scheduling
which is the core Linux scheduling concept relevant to this project.

## 6. Scheduler Experiment Results

### Experiment 1: CPU-bound vs I/O-bound
| Container | Workload  | Observed CPU% |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| cpu1      | cpu_hog   | ~99%          |
| io1       | io_pulse  | ~1-2%         |

io_pulse spends most of its time in usleep(), giving up the CPU voluntarily.
cpu_hog never yields, consuming its full time slice every scheduling period.
This shows that I/O-bound processes are naturally "polite" to the scheduler.

### Experiment 2: Different nice values
| Container  | nice | Observed CPU% | Completion Time |
|------------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| high_prio  | 0    | ~99%          | 59.262s             |
| low_prio   | 19   | ~99%          | 59.723s             |


The CFS scheduler allocated CPU share proportional to the process weights
derived from nice values, consistent with the documented behavior where
nice=19 has weight 15 and nice=0 has weight 1024 in the kernel's weight table.
